# weather-or-not-bot
A laconic weather bot for Telegram built with Go and love. <br/>

Web-based Telegram bot that uses external weather API to get a forecast or
current conditions data, formats and sends it to a user. The latter has several options: to choose a location (the current one or any city in the
world), to choose a forecast format (by hours or days) as well as to choose
precision (from 24 hours up to 16 days ahead). <br/>

_Requested feature: bot only includes detailed information about the forecast iff the weather actually changes through
 time._
